# Recommendation Engine by Sakshi Pandey

This project is an attempt to help farmers by recommending them a crop which is most suitable for their land. The suitability is decided on the basis of various factors such as pH level, Nitrogen, Potassium etc. The algorithm use is *KNN algorithm*, which is a sort of classifier algorithm used in Machine Learning. 

Reference: [Medium blog link](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761#:~:text=Summary,both%20classification%20and%20regression%20problems.)

**Motivation:** India is an agrarian country with around 48.9%* of its people depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture and still has very less farm productivity. A total of 5,650 farmers have committedsuicides during 2014, accounting for 4.3% of total suicides victims in the country. Hence, farm productivity needs to be increased so that farmers can get more pay from the same piece of land with less labour.

# Challenges Faced
---
"If you are not facing challenges while developing an application, you are not considering every possible case for a better experience of your users."

During the development process I faced the following challenges:
 1. Understanding new tech stacks as I had no prior knowledge other than basic HTML and CSS before. However, thanks to online communities, stackoverflow, my mentor and friends I was able to find resources which helped me in creating this web application.
 2. Preparing a feature list. In the beginning I wanted to build an app like no other and incorporate as many features as I could. But in the interest of time, I had to narrow down the features to the most basic functionalities. :(
 3. Time Management: During the 1st 3 weeks of program I had my end semester examinations (that too in offline mode after almost 2 years), hence I could not dedicate as much time as I should.

All these challenges were less of challenges and more of lessons, lessons to help me have an even better development process in the future and to not give up even till the end. 

# Future Scope
---
The web application can be improved by adding the following features.

1. A chatbot which can entertain queries of farmers.
2. Multi-lingual options
3. Nearest soil testing lab location
4. User registration through Aadhar Number
5. A disease detection model for crops
